# TextToLED

A package to control a 5x5x5 LED cube using a CMOD S6 FPGA device and a Raspberry Pi.

Code includes alphabetical encodings to allow cube to display 3D text in sequence.

Sends bit strings from RasPi to FPGA. Signals are mutliplexed and forwarded to LED cube.

Cube is built with 25 columns and 5 layers. Each column is powered by a unique VCC pin. Each layer is grounded to a unique 0V pin.

When a 5V signal is sent to a specific column, and a 0V signal is sent to a specific layer, a single LED can be illuminated.
